    >Since the beginning of this adventure, my goal has always been to create a better world for my children. Memories
    are priceless, and privacy should not be a luxury. However, building quality open source has its challenges. Over
    the past two years, it has taken significant dedication, time, and effort.</Text

  <Text
    >Recently, a company in Austin, Texas, called FUTO contacted the team. FUTO strives to develop quality and
    sustainable open software. They build software alternatives that focus on giving control to users. From their
    mission statement:</Text

      >FUTO loved Immich and wanted to see if we'd consider working with them to take the project to the next level. In
      short, FUTO offered to:</Text

    <List>
      <li>Pay the core team to work on Immich full-time</li>
      <li>Let us keep full autonomy about the project's direction and leadership</li>
      <li>Continue to license Immich under AGPL</li>
      <li>Keep Immich's development direction with no paywalled features</li>
      <li>Keep Immich “built for the people” (no ads, data mining/selling, or alternative motives)</li>
      <li>Provide us with financial, technical, legal, and administrative support</li>
    </List>

  <Text
    >After careful deliberation, the team decided that FUTO's vision closely aligns with our own: to build a better
    future by providing a polished, performant, and privacy-preserving open-source software solution for photo and video
    management delivered in a sustainable way.</Text

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <Heading tag="h3">Will the license change?</Heading>
      <Text>No. Immich will continue to be licensed under AGPL without a CLA.</Text>
    </section>

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <Heading tag="h3">Will Immich continue to be free?</Heading>
      <Text>Yes. The Immich source code will remain freely available under the AGPL license.</Text>

    <section class="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <Heading tag="h3">Is Immich getting VC funding?</Heading>
      <Text>
        No. Venture capital implies investment in a business, often with the expectation of a future payout (exit plan).
        Immich is neither a business that can be acquired nor comes with a money-making exit plan.

      >
      <Text>
        Effective immediately, all donations to the Immich organization will be canceled. In the future, we will offer
        an optional, modest payment option instead. Thank you to everyone who donated to help us get this far!

      <Heading tag="h3">How is funding sustainable?</Heading>
      <Text>
        Immich and FUTO believe a sustainable future requires a model that does not rely on users-as-a-product. To this
        end, FUTO advocates that users pay for good, open software. In keeping with this model, we will adopt a purchase
        price. This means we no longer accept donations, but — <em
          >without limiting features for those who do not pay</em
        >
        — we will soon allow you to purchase Immich through a modest payment. We encourage you to pay for the high-quality
        software you use to foster a healthy software culture where developers build great applications without hidden motives
        for their users.
