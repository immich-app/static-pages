Welcome to Immich `v3.2.0`!

This release includes many new features as well as the usual collection of bug fixes and cleanups. Keep reading below for a list of highlights.

## Highlights

- Docker compose builder
- Revamped search UI (web)
- Search API v2 (server)
- View own people in shared assets, cross-user clustering
- Workflow tags trigger and actions
- Dedicated memories page
- Tag renaming (web)
- View assets in map viewport (web)

### Docker compose builder

We recently released our new [docker compose builder](https://immich.app/docker-compose-builder), which lets you put together a custom compose file for Immich more easily. Please try it out and give us [your feedback](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/31232)!

### Search API v2 (server)

We have built an entirely new search API that, amongst other things, will support searching within albums and combining multiple search filters with both AND and OR operations. Some of these features will be exposed to the search UI interfaces in the future, others will be used to power other fancy features as well as give 3rd party tools more functionality. If you are interested in the particular changes and examples for how to use the new API, feel free to check out the PR <https://github.com/immich-app/immich/pull/30179> as well as our API documentation at <https://api.immich.app/endpoints/search/searchAssets>.

### Revamped search UI (web)

We have a new designer who helped us remodel the search modal, which has been pretty complex before and looks a lot more visually appealing in our opinion now. It still supports the same functionality, but with some quality of life additions as well as a significantly simpler look. In the future, we will extend this to also include some of the new features enabled by the new search API. Stay tuned and give us your feedback on the new design!

### View own people in shared assets

We are very happy to ship the first step towards better sharing. You can now have people recognized across trusted users, which also allows you to view people you already have records of in any shared assets!

In the user sharing settings (<https://my.immich.app/user-settings?isOpen=sharing>) there is a new section; cluster group.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/a9dd3d5f7d6e6fb06bf9cf5d9a2b4dec-1472.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/a9dd3d5f7d6e6fb06bf9cf5d9a2b4dec-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/a9dd3d5f7d6e6fb06bf9cf5d9a2b4dec-1080.avif 1080w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/a9dd3d5f7d6e6fb06bf9cf5d9a2b4dec-1472.avif 1472w" width="1472" height="682" alt="The user sharing settings showing a cluster group with Jane Doe and Mich in it" />

You can invite users on your instance that you trust to your own group, or join another group you have been invited to. These cluster groups make it possible to identify people in assets shared by users in the same group. They also likely improve accuracy, as the clustering will operate on a bigger pool of faces. People names and birth dates are still set on a per-user level and aren’t (yet) shared with users in the same group.

As of now, this requires resetting facial recognition for all users in the group, in order for the changes to apply retroactively for all assets. This means, names and birth dates will be lost, and the results can vary slightly compared to before. Only faces recognized by machine learning will be affected by this. We may be able to do some non-destructive merging in the future, but for now this is a necessary step in order to fully benefit from the feature. That is why we put a button in the sharing settings for every user in the group (specifically also non-admins) to reset the facial recognition for that group.

### Workflow tags trigger and actions

Workflows have gotten a new trigger. You can now do automations when an asset has been tagged.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6c69fbf49347d77fecfb0e0defb7a4eb-1246.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6c69fbf49347d77fecfb0e0defb7a4eb-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6c69fbf49347d77fecfb0e0defb7a4eb-1080.avif 1080w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6c69fbf49347d77fecfb0e0defb7a4eb-1246.avif 1246w" width="1246" height="734" alt="Available workflow triggers showing the new &quot;Asset Tagged&quot; trigger" />In order to use this new trigger, there is also a new filter that allows you to match specific tags. It supports matching for _all_, _any_, or _none_ in the provided list.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/d4ddf8547741278aad68783016aaf546-1248.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/d4ddf8547741278aad68783016aaf546-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/d4ddf8547741278aad68783016aaf546-1080.avif 1080w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/d4ddf8547741278aad68783016aaf546-1248.avif 1248w" width="1248" height="1000" alt="Configuration of the &quot;Filter by tags&quot; filter showing a combobox to pick tags, as well as a &quot;Matching&quot; dropdown" />

Lastly, a new workflow action to add tags to the current asset has also been added. It allows to add a list of tags at once.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/58476d04f2eca447d037d2ef4fb262fc-1236.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/58476d04f2eca447d037d2ef4fb262fc-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/58476d04f2eca447d037d2ef4fb262fc-1080.avif 1080w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/58476d04f2eca447d037d2ef4fb262fc-1236.avif 1236w" width="1236" height="816" alt="Configuration of the &quot;Add Tags&quot; action showing a combobox to pick tags." />

### Dedicated memories page

The new memories page allows you to view past memories. You can also favorite memories and they will show up here and never get deleted. The goal is for this to be a place you can come back to at any point and reminisce in old memories.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/b5d448ad3d7a391cb8797073e456718f-2160.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/b5d448ad3d7a391cb8797073e456718f-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/b5d448ad3d7a391cb8797073e456718f-1080.avif 1080w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/b5d448ad3d7a391cb8797073e456718f-1440.avif 1440w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/b5d448ad3d7a391cb8797073e456718f-2160.avif 2160w" width="2160" height="1328" alt="New memories page showing a variety of memories from the past couple of years" />

### Tag renaming (web)

Finally, you can also rename existing tags. This is a small addition to the edit tag modal on web, but under the hood was more complicated than you might expect.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/feca52ab6520b77495df67b53cd3c2a9-854.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/feca52ab6520b77495df67b53cd3c2a9-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/feca52ab6520b77495df67b53cd3c2a9-854.avif 854w" width="854" height="756" alt="Edit tag modal showing that the name can also be edited now" />

### View assets in map viewport (web)

Similarly to showing a timeline all assets in a cluster on the map when clicking on it, you can now open a timeline for assets currently in the viewport. There is a new button among the map controls to show assets in the area. It will open a timeline that will update as you pan around the map.

<Markdown.Image src="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6983f3070f454e3e6dea987c892990d5-2160.avif" srcset="https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6983f3070f454e3e6dea987c892990d5-720.avif 720w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6983f3070f454e3e6dea987c892990d5-1080.avif 1080w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6983f3070f454e3e6dea987c892990d5-1440.avif 1440w, https://static.immich.cloud/blog/6a66f5d5-96bc-4510-ab1c-06504fb9d3de/6983f3070f454e3e6dea987c892990d5-2160.avif 2160w" width="2160" height="1457" alt="The map page showing a timeline of assets currently in the viewport on the right" />
