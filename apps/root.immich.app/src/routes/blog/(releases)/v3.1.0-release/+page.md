Welcome to Immich `v3.1.0`!

This release includes several quality of life improvements and another round of bug fixes. Keep reading below for the complete highlights.

## Highlights

- Upload wakelock (web)
- Undo archive (web)
- Filter assets by server filepath (workflows)
- Quick navigate to maintenance page (web)
- Better slideshow button accessibility (web)
- OIDC role claim sync improvements (OAuth)
- Invalidate sessions on password reset (admin-cli)

### Upload wakelock (web)

Similar to mobile, the web application will now automatically acquire a wakelock to prevent the screen from dimming while uploads are happening. This feature will require an HTTPS connection.

### Undo archive (web)

After archiving assets, the success notification now has an “undo” button to undo the action.

![Undo button on success notification](https://static.immich.cloud/blog/48ff8c50-260a-4114-a8a0-117d8989f622/48fe5c0071ecd3700696ea24516267dd.webp)

### Filter assets by server filepath (workflows)

The asset file filter has a new option “Use path”. When set to true, it will filter based on the actual path on the server rather than the original file name.

### Filter assets by EXIF metadata (workflows)

A new workflow filter has been added that allows you to filter assets based on their EXIF metadata fields. For now it only supports string comparisons, with numerical comparisons expected to come soon.

### Quick navigate to maintenance page (web)

The command palette (`CTRL+K` or `/`) now includes an item for the maintenance page.

### Better slideshow button visibility (web)

The slideshow buttons on the web are now wrapped in a container with a backdrop blur, making them easier to view when the current asset is very light.

### OIDC role claim sync improvements (OAuth)

The OAuth integration in Immich supports setting an initial `isAdmin` value for new users via a role claim. This same process has been updated to now _sync_ `isAdmin` on subsequent logins. Additionally, the role claim now supports both single values (`immich_role: 'admin'`) in addition to lists of values ( `immich_role: ["admin", "user"]`), making in more flexible.

### Invalidate sessions on password reset (admin-cli)

When using the admin command line interface to reset a password, there is now a new option to invalidate existing sessions.

```none
immich-admin reset-admin-password
Found Admin:
- ID=e65e6f88-2a30-4dbe-8dd9-1885f4889b53
- OAuth ID=
- Email=admin@example.com
- Name=Immich Admin
? Please choose a new password (optional) immich-is-cool
? Invalidate existing sessions? Yes
The admin password has been updated.
```

### Date range for map (mobile)

Similar to web, mobile now also supports filtering the map for assets within a given date range.
