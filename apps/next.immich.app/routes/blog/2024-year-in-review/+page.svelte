  <Text>Hi everyone,</Text>

  <Text>Alex from Immich here.</Text>

  <Text>On behalf of the team, I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your support in 2024.</Text>

    >Since the first day I posted the <Link
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/si5lp6/i_am_building_a_selfhosted_alternative_version_of/"
      external>video prototype</Link
    > on the <Link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">selfhosted</Link> subreddit, Immich has been on a journey.
    I still remember the project‚Äôs early days and loved seeing those first issues open on GitHub. How exciting it has been
    to build something useful for so many people. I am grateful for the compassionate community as well as the feedback and
    criticism we have received this year.</Text

  <Text
    >The project's core idea is to do good things without a hidden agenda or ill motives, to give people a delightful
    choice to manage their digital media besides the solutions from exploitative big cloud providers. Just last year, we
    were daydreaming of how wonderful it would be if we could do those things daily as our full-time job. One might have
    said it is good karma, but Louis Rossman from FUTO found us and extended the invitation for the company to fund the
    project to let us develop the software full-time. It was a dream come true for all the core contributors to talk
    about Immich, interact with the users, have fun writing code, and build out the features of Immich every day. We
    would not be here without your love and support for the project.</Text
